What happens if I insert custom elements and attributes? Is that the feature named Polyglot markup that

<html>
	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
	
	<p myCustomAttribute = "This one doesn't start with data-*">This paragraph had a custom attribute that didn't start with <b>data-*</b>.</p>
	
	<p><foo>This is a new paragraph but this content or text is within a custom element named &lt;foo&gt;.</foo></p>
</html>
