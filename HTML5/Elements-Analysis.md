## An analysis of the study of all HTML elements until and including HTML5

[Inventory taking](https://github.com/Sathyaish/Practice/blob/master/HTML5/Elements.md) of [all the HTML elements](https://github.com/Sathyaish/Practice/blob/master/HTML5/Elements-All.md) until and including HTML5 has revealed that there aren't very many important HTML tags that I didn't know of already. One can make a list of the ones that actually matter in the building of websites simply by recollection from memory and experience of having used HTML to whatever degree. There's only a few other important ones that one might not be easily able to recollect but would have used in the past and would know of them when they're mentioned.

Here, I categorize all elements as *ones that are utterly useless*, *the useful ones*, *the useful ones that have to do with appearance, or are user interface elements or controls*, *ones that are semantic and utterly useless*, *ones that have been deprecated or are soon likely to be*, and so on. I still don't know if these will be the exact classification I will end up with. I am simply trying to arrange them in my head so that only the most important ones are stored in the area of my memory where I need to recall them in daily use.
