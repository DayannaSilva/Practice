## An analysis of the study of all HTML elements until and including HTML5

[Inventory taking](https://github.com/Sathyaish/Practice/blob/master/HTML5/Elements.md) of [all the HTML elements](https://github.com/Sathyaish/Practice/blob/master/HTML5/Elements-All.md) until and including HTML5 has revealed that there aren't very many important HTML tags that I didn't know of already. One can make a list of the ones that actually matter in the building of websites simply by recollection from memory and experience of having used HTML to whatever degree. There's only a few other important ones that one might not be easily able to recollect but would have used in the past and would know of them when they're mentioned.

Here, I categorize all elements as *ones that are utterly useless*, *the useful ones*, *the useful ones that have to do with appearance, or are user interface elements or controls*, *ones that are semantic and utterly useless*, *ones that have been deprecated or are soon likely to be*, and so on. I still don't know if these will be the exact classification I will end up with. I am simply trying to arrange them in my head so that only the most important ones are stored in the area of my memory where I need to recall them in daily use.

### How I define usefulness
Utility is subjective, and since I am doing this exercise only for my own benefit, so I must define what it means to me for an element be considered useful.

Furthermore, not only is usefulness subjective, but its subjectivity is rooted in the value system or goal it serves. So, at different times, which tag / element, or for that matter any idea, is useful to me will differ. When I study HTML only for the sake of study, i.e. to be able to teach it to others and to be able to answer any question about its vocabulary effectively, then *all* the elements are useful. But when I have to build something, I must ruthelessly define a very restrictive sense of utitlity.

Hence, for this time, my goal being to build software, my definition of utility or usefulness is rather restrictive. If anything is not *absolutely necessary* in that *I would be better off doing it with a declarative HTML tag than by defining CSS on an ambivalant HTML element like `<span>`*, then such an element is *not* useful for me to rent my brain space for, at least at this time.

It may be argued that anything could be done by defining CSS on the ambivalant `<span>`. So, why bother making this list at all? So, I must furnish a few examples.

For e.g. one needs not to argue about the normative elements such as `html`, `body`, `meta`, `link`, `base` and so on.

Further in the reportoire of examples, I couldn't draw a table as easily with CSS as I could by using the `table` element. However, I could easily emphasise anything I wanted to without using the `em` element.

Simlary, elements such as `var`, `kbd`, `tt` and `code` are extremely narrow in their use-cases, and are mostly purely semantic, their aesthetic being the same. I would put them all in one category that I *kind of know and even remember but don't care so much about.*
