## Analysis

[Inventory taking] of [all the HTML elements] until and including HTML5 has revealed that there aren't very many important HTML tags that I didn't know of already. One can make a list of the ones that actually matter in the building of websites simply by recollection from memory and experience of having used HTML to whatever degree. There's only a few other important ones that one might not be easily able to recollect but would have used in the past and would know of them when they're mentioned.
