    Will compile as follows:

    msbuild <FileName.xml> -p[roperty]:Color=Red -p[property]:PersonName="Sathyaish Chakravarthy"

    Expected output:

    Color: Blue
    Person: Sathyaish Chakravarthy

    Because by default, unless otherwise specified in the <Project> element's TreatAsLocalProperty attribute,
    a property value that is specified on the command-line overrides the value specifie in the project file.

    Note that in this example, I am also trying whether or not I can specify a property value that has a space
    using the command-line. I am not sure what's going to happen. I didn't read it anywhere. Let's see what happens.

    ACTUAL OUTPUT:

    The TreatAsLocalProperty behavior works just as expected.

    If I specify the value that has a space but without using quotes, I get an error like so:

    > msbuild <FileName.xml> -p:PersonName=Sathyaish Chakravarthy

    MSBUILD : error MSB1008: Only one project can be specified.

    With the string quoted, it works just fine. Like so:

    > msbuild <FileName.xml> -p:PersonName="Sathyaish Chakravarthy"

    Just mind that there shouldn't be spaces on the commandline surrounding 
    the = sign like we like to have in code for readability. Otherwise, and obviously,
    the command-line parser gets confused.
