	Does the build stop if a target or task fails? Let's see.
	
	After I see what happens by default, the next thing I want to try is: how to make the build stop if a target or task fails?
	
	I will also use an rsp file for this one named "WhatHappensIfTaskFails.rsp" to specify that all targets must be executed.
