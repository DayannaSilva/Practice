<!-- I will be executing more than one target on the command line, like so: 

> msbuild.exe /t:One;Four

Leaving out targets Two and Three. I do this just to see how to specify on the command line
that more than one target needs to be executed.

The help switch:

> msbuild.exe/?

reads on this topic as follows:

/target:<targets>  Build these targets in this project. Use a semicolon or a
                   comma to separate multiple targets, or specify each
                   target separately. (Short form: /t)
                   Example:
                     /target:Resources;Compile
