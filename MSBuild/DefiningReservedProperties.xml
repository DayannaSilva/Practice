<!-- 
	As per the documentation, reserved properties cannot be defined in a project.
	
	I want to see what happens if I do that.
	
	I first printed all properties (environment variables and reserved ones) for a simple project file using the /v[erbosity]:diag[nostic] switch.
	
	I noted there's a reserved property named MSBuildProjectDirectory. Let's see what happens if I define a property of that name.
	
	Ok, the build fails with the following error message:
	
	: error MSB4004: The "MSBuildProjectDirectory" property is reserved, and cannot be modified.
