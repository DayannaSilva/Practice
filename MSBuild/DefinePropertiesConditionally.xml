    Will define two property groups, both conditionally. One's condition will
    fail and the other will pass. Then I will just print out all the four properties
    to see what happens.

    Also, in this example we learn how to include line-breaks within a string
    we want printed in a <Message> task by using the property function named Escape
    in the class MSBuild. See this Stack Overflow answer:

    I'll create a separate example for property functions. Just like in Powershell, they're
    basically expressions invoking .NET methods from within the place where you put the value
    of a property when declaring it.
    
    Prints:

    Print:
    One: One
    Two: Two
    Three:
    Four:

    <PropertyGroup Condition = "'4' > '2'">
        <One>One</One>
        <Two>Two</Two>
    </PropertyGroup>

    <PropertyGroup Condition = "'Some String' == 'Some Other String'">
        <Three>Three</Three>
        <Four>Four</Four>
    </PropertyGroup>

    <PropertyGroup>
        <NewLine>%0A</NewLine>
    </PropertyGroup>

    <Target Name = "Print">
        <Message Text = "$([MSBuild]::Escape('One: $(One)$(NewLine)Two: $(Two)$(NewLine)Three: $(Three)$(NewLine)Four: $(Four)'))" />
    </Target>
</Project>
