    While doing some practice, specifically while trying to create a vignette for an <img>
    using a radial gradient (see radial-gradient-vignette.html), I observed that I could not
    change the src attribute of an <img> tag using CSS. I had bumped into this issue earlier but
    chose not to acknowledge it formally. Now, I acknowledge it. Further research on this topic confirms
    the limitation. You cannot change the src of an img using HTML and/or CSS. You can do that only with
    JavaScript. Perhaps the philosophy behind this implementation is that CSS must only be allowed to 
    change visual appearance and not content. And src is the content of the image.

    The purpose of this example is to see whether or not setting a background-image in CSS
    will have the same effect as changing the src of the <img> as this answer on Stack Overflow
    alludes to. I doubt it would because the old src image would still be there and the default
    background-blend-mode does not behave in a way to have the background image take visual precedence
    over the src image.

    Title: Replace image src location using CSS

    Okay, until you do not set box-sizing and padding, it won't work.
    But the same answer above, in the comments section links to
    another article which contains a hack.

    https://css-tricks.com/replace-the-image-in-an-img-with-css/

    The hack is, you set the padding-left of the original inline
    image (src) to the number of pixels equal to "the width of the
    background-image you set or the width of the original image," whichever
    is wider.

    And just to be sure, change the box-sizing to border box.
    
    And change the width and height of the image equal to the width
    of the new image you put in the background.

    Phew!
