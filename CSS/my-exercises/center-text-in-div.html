<head>
    <style>
        div {
            box-sizing: border-box;
            width: 600px;
            height: 300px;
            border: 4px solid red;

            display: table-cell;
            vertical-align: middle;
            text-align: center;
            padding: 0 150px 0 150px;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <div>
        This is a long piece of text that runs into many lines of reading. Some people like to sleep, and some like to drink water.
        This is looking like a poem. It is even aligned like one. What a pity!
