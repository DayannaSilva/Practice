<html>
    <head>
        <style>
            div {
                width: 800px;
                height: 500px;
                border: 4px solid red;

                display: table-cell;
                vertical-align: middle;
                text-align: center;
                padding: 20px;
            }
        </style>
    </head>

    <body>
        <div>
            This text will be centered both horizontally and vertically. This has multiple lines
            and a left alignment, but still, it centers in the div nicely.
