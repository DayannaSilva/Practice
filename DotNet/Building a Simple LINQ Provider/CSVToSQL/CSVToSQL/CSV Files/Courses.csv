Moreover, an easier task is to transaction-enable .NET applications. .NET provides you with the classes to do just that. If that is the case, then why a course about transactions? Well, that is because just like everything else in programming, you need to understand the architecture, the underground of whatever seems to be an easy task. Only then can you design solutions as opposed to only coding them. WCF transactions are built from ground up around .NET transactions.

hibernate-introduction,Introduction To Hibernate,14288,2013-07-30,"In the world of Java, one of the most popular and widely used frameworks is Hibernate. Hibernate is an ORM, or Object Relational Mapper, that allows developers to map Java objects to relational database tables. It is a valuable tool that all Java developers should know how to use. The problem is, learning Hibernate can be difficult. Hibernate is a very large framework and there are many important concepts to understand to use it effectively. This course is designed to make getting started with Hibernate as easy as possible and focus on the most important things you need to know. We start off this course by learning a bit about Hibernate and how it works, and then see how to get it setup with a real MySQL database installation. After that, we learn the very basics of mapping, which is one of the most important things to understand about Hibernate. I'll show you how to create a basic mapping for a Java object to a relational table and explain to you how the mapping works. But most real world applications have more complex mapping that often trips up new developers and experienced developers alike. So, we'll also cover some of the complex mapping situations like mapping collections and different relational mappings like one-to-many and many-to-one. Once you've learned how to map you objects, you'll want to know how to query them, so I'll show you how to do this using Hibernate's built in HQL and using a more object oriented approach with the Criteria API. Finally, we'll wrap things up by taking a brief tour of some of the more advanced features like caching and interceptors. So, if you are wanting to learn how to use Hibernate, or if you've been struggling through using Hibernate in an existing application, but never really understood what was going on, this course will give you the knowledge you need to feel confident about how Hibernate works and how to use it.",Live,no

uml-introduction,Introduction to UML,8006,2013-09-09,"Seldom does a software project of any size get built by only one person. Most often many different people, with different skills work together to build the solution. It is not uncommon to have the technology not be the most challenging part of the project, but rather it is often the lack of clear communication between the project team members. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) helps the team members to communicate clearly and precisely. The UML includes several diagrams and models that support the design of different aspects of the solution. If each member of the team is able to understand those models that are useful to them they are more likely to understand each other, and the challenges and risks of different understandings and views of the solution are minimized. In this course we review the need for this clear communication. We discuss several of the common diagrams that teams use to model a software solution and identify some of the team members that most commonly use the diagram. The UML is very large and there is much that can be done with it beyond what is covered in this introductory course.

When it happens in your environment, do you know what to do? Will you realize you have corruption? Written and presented by the person who wrote SQL Server's consistency checking and repair tools, this course will show you what you need to know to detect and recover from most cases of database corruption. The course starts by explaining why timely corruption detection is so important, and then investigates the various causes of database corruption. You'll learn how to configure SQL Server to automatically detect when I/O errors occur, what consistency checks are, the DBCC commands to use to perform consistency checks, and how to configure SQL Server to perform consistency checks regularly. The course then moves on to interpreting the output from consistency checks so you'll know when you have corruption in your environment, plus whether and how the corruption limits your recovery options or not. Finally, the course ends with modules that describe and demonstrate how to recover from corruption using simple restore techniques and simple repair techniques. Packed with a wealth of information and practical, easy-to-follow demonstrations, this course will prepare you to detect and recover from database corruption when it happens to you.

This is the real key to success in any automation effort. In this course, I will reveal every secret I know from creating several successful automation frameworks and consulting on the creation of others. I will show you exactly, step-by-step how to create your own automation framework and I will explain to you the reasoning behind everything we are doing, so you can apply what you learn to your own framework. We’ll start off this course by going over the basics of automation and talking about why it is so important as well as discuss some of the common reasons for success and failure. Then, I’ll take you into the architecture of an automation framework and show you why you need to pay careful attention to the structure of any framework you build and give you some of the underlying design principles I use when creating an automation framework. After that we’ll be ready to start creating a framework.

sqlserver-why-physical-db-design-matters,SQL Server: Why Physical Database Design Matters,14163,2013-09-27,"This course is about how your database’s physical design either takes advantage of or is hindered by the way that the SQL Server platform works; knowing this can give you better long-term scalability, availability, and performance. Choosing the right data types when you're designing your columns, tables, and indexes is really critical. Using the wrong data type can cause more space to be required, affecting data density in memory, database and backup size, transaction log efficiency, and more. It's even more important when you're choosing your clustering keys, as the wrong choice there can cause nonclustered index sizes to balloon dramatically. It can even affect the performance of queries, when incompatible data types are used in comparisons and cause very costly operations to take place. This course will show you how to make the right choices and avoid all of these problems. It starts by explaining the various data structures that are used to store columns and rows, and how they can be affected by data type choice. Then it shows how data type choice factors into clustered and nonclustered index key choice. Finally it describes the implicit conversion and probe residual problems that can occur from mismatched data types used in queries. Packed with a wealth of information and practical, easy-to-follow demonstrations, this course will show you how to make the RIGHT choices to make sure you avoid all these common problems. The course is applicable for all SQL Server versions from SQL Server 2005 onward, and for SQL Server developers and anyone responsible for designing and creating SQL Server tables and indexes, with any level of experience.",Live,no

In this course, I’ll show you the basics of creating an iOS application as we build a complete iOS application learning what we need to know about Objective-C along the way. We’ll start out by learning a little bit about iOS in general and the iOS development environment. Then, we’ll jump right in and create out first Hello World iOS application as we set up our development environment and learn the basics of the IDE we use for iOS development, Xcode. After that, I’ll show you the core things you need to know to build any application, how to build a user interface and interact with it. We’ll learn how to use Xcode’s Interface Builder tool to create a very basic IU and interact with it. Once we’ve got the basics covered, we’ll start building our first real application. We’ll learn a few new concepts as we build our application, like how to use the iOS storyboarding feature to creating a multi-screen application and how to setup navigation in our application. Finally, we’ll finish up our iOS application by learning how to add user settings to the app and how to show the user a simple notification through the use of alerts. So, if you are looking to get started with iOS development and are looking for an easy and gentle way to get introduced to the environment and tools while building a real application, this course is exactly what you need. You won’t be an expert at iOS development after taking this course, but this course will definitely give you a head start in learning the platform and show you the basics you need to know before taking a more advanced course.",Live,no

After that, we’ll create a very basic Hello World application as we go through the pretty simple process of installing the Firefox OS simulator and creating a very basic application to run inside it. Once we have those basics down, we’ll go straight into creating our first application. First, I’ll show you how to create a hosted application which is an application that you can actually host on your own webserver, but is installed like any other mobile app on Firefox OS. Then, we’ll create another full application, as we learn how to create a packaged application that is able to access more of the APIs that Firefox OS only exposed to apps that are actually installed on the device. We’ll still use the same HTML 5 technologies you are used to for this application, but we won’t need to host the app ourselves, because the user will install in directly on their device. Finally, I’ll take you through the process of deploying your Firefox OS applications.

sqlserver-optimizing-adhoc-statement-performance,SQL Server: Optimizing Ad Hoc Statement Performance,26152,2013-12-06,"This course is about how different ad hoc statement execution methods affect caching, plan reuse, memory and ultimately performance. Knowing when to use each method is important and understanding how SQL Server works will demystify certain behaviors you may have seen but previously have been unable to explain. SQL Server can support any workload, any design, and any data requests but knowing exactly which one is the most beneficial to use can give you better long-term scalability, availability, and performance. Using the wrong method can cause more memory to be wasted and even result in parameter sniffing problems (where subsequent statements perform poorly because of the plan that’s been cached). This course will show you how each statement execution method works, how it’s cached, whether or not it wastes cache, and finally how to test and rewrite the statement to take better advantage of caching. Along the way we will also cover a variety of other necessary features and tools: estimates, statistics, and heuristics; how to analyze query plans; some indexing strategies to improve performance; and plan guides. This course is an absolute must for everyone that works with SQL Server and it’s also an introduction to concepts that will be built upon in future courses. This course is applicable to all SQL Server versions from SQL Server 2005 onward, and for SQL Server developers as well as anyone responsible for writing data access statements to SQL Server tables. You can have any level of experience to gain from this course but those of you who have experienced what seemed odd behavior/performance with your ad hoc statements will probably benefit the most!",Live,no

We first look at how the shift in technology trends established the need for a different breed of technologies. Columnar, or Column-Oriented, databases have become increasingly popular in data warehousing applications because they allow for better compression and multi-fold performance improvements, and we'll see how SQL Server 2014 implements this with clustered columnstore indexes. In addition, as technology makes a bigger shift in hardware to multi-core CPU architectures and large amounts of memory are even cheaper and more attainable, it's important for software to adjust and utilize these changes. We'll see how In-Memory OLTP addresses these trends and more, letting you create tables in memory, eliminating locks and implementing optimistic multi-version concurrency. This course discusses in depth In-Memory OLTP (memory optimized tables), previously known as Hekaton. We'll cover creating memory-optimized tables, loading data, durability and the affect that has on the transaction log. We'll also look at indexing in detail, explaining the new index types created specifically to support In-Memory OLTP and how and when to apply each type based on your use case and we'll discuss how In-Memory OLTP and Clustered Columnstore indexes can fit a variety of applications while comparing them with each other and traditional disk-based tables and indexes.",Live,no

developing-extensible-software,Developing Extensible Software,13582,2014-02-05,"In today's competitive world of software development, using methodologies such as Agile lets us get products to market quicker and in a controlled fashion, but that's not enough. Applications need to be able to grow without being totally rewritten. Sure, there eventually comes a time when every app needs a major overhaul, but if applications are written to be extensible in the first place, the overhaul can be performed in pieces; and in the meantime, new features can be added or existing features changed without bringing the app down. This ""extensibility"" in our design is becoming more and more important every day as software shops compete with each other for work and even with other countries. There have been many articles and design documents written on things like inversion of control in the UI tiers. Many books have dedicated chapters to injecting objects into MVC controllers or WPF ViewModels, but not many have focused on the meat of a system, the business tiers. These are the tiers that are accessible to the UI of a system, more than one in many cases. And these are the tiers that can be most volatile and subject to change and enhancement. In this course, I'll show you some of my favorite extensibility designs and techniques which will let you write software in building blocks that can be connected and interconnected in different ways. I'll keep most of my focus on the business tiers, which despite the lack of user-centric visual glamour, is where you get to exercise the most creativity. You'll be able to roll out applications and continuously add or change things without affecting the core infrastructure in place. To me, this not only makes the software better, but more fun to write!",Live,no

However, before solving the problem, you need to understand it. After an introduction to temporal problems and constraints, you will learn how to implement the solutions. Many solutions are much simpler with the help of a special Interval CLR data type. Additional relational operators PACK and UNPACK are handy as well. Of course, these two operators do not exist in the Transact-SQL language. You will learn how to implement them with help of other language elements. Having a SQL Server solution for a problem does not mean the job is done. Of course, the next immediate issue is performance. Temporal queries that involve intervals are typically very IO and CPU intensive. For example, a test for overlapping intervals was solved with inefficient queries for years. However, a handful of solutions with fast queries was developed recently. This course introduces five different methods to get efficient queries that search for overlapping intervals, one of the most complex temporal problems.

improving-testability-through-design,Improving Testability Through Design,16579,2014-08-11,"A well designed application is not necessarily the one which has a perfect separation of layers, or the one which perfectly implements some predefined design patterns. It is certainly a plus to have these two goals met, but that is not sufficient to make the application really good. We can learn the most about one application by reading the source code of particular methods embedded deep inside of it. A common for loop often reveals more about the design than the whole diagram depicting responsibilities of an application layer in which it is located. The devil is in the details. The best of all intentions in design fails miserably when the low-profile design of small, seemingly unimportant classes is misconceived. In this course, the order of decisions is sorted bottom-up. It is the small class to which we pay attention the most. Only when all things are in place at the microscopic level can we discuss responsibilities of layers, isolation of modules and other high profile topics.

There's enough stuff out there in the development world to keep us both excited and overwhelmed. Learning new tech has become easier with the all the information available to us, especially in the way of these Pluralsight courses. But learning how to use a technology and learning how to properly implement it or integrate it with other technologies can be a whole different ballgame. Service-Oriented systems have become mainstream, but designing applications in a service-oriented fashion require a different look on the components that make it up as well as technologies to support the architecture. This course will bring it all together for you by building on knowledge you have on technologies like WCF, Web API, ASP.NET MVC, WPF, and AngularJS and going from A to Z on the architecture, design, development, and testing of a complete system. And this system will not only use a multitude of technologies in the middle-tier, but will also be consumed by different UI clients on the web and the desktop. Know how to write services in WCF and Web API, but want to see some real-world implementation from both MVC and WPF clients, then this course is for you. Want to know how to implement dependency injection from the middle tier to the various UIs, then this course is for you. Want to write decoupled, testable software, then this course is for you.

secure-account-management-fundamentals,Secure Account Management Fundamentals,25271,2015-01-03,"A fundamental component of many modern day applications is the ability to create and manage user accounts. So many of the services we use every day as consumers and build as developers depend on the ability for customers to register, login, and then perform tasks under their identity. However, every day we see a barrage of attacks against poorly implemented account management facilities. These range from brute force attacks against the login to the impersonation of authenticated users, to the cracking of breached passwords. Often, weaknesses in account management facilities are simply due to the developers not having thought through the potential risks from a hacker's mindset. This course demonstrates how attackers think and exploit these weaknesses. There are numerous high-profile precedents including the celebrity iCloud photo hack, GitHub account attacks and Dropbox credential disclosure. In some of these cases, oversights in secure account management practices left systems unnecessarily vulnerable whilst in others, good practices undoubtedly mitigated the scale of the damage caused.
