1. What is it? As in, what problem does it solve?

2. Show me, do it and show me. Write some code so I understand what problem it solves.

3. How does it work?

------------------

4. Prerequisites: What do I need to know before I am ready to learn Rx?

5. How to install it and use it in Visual Studio? What are all the ways to get it?

6. How to deploy a program that uses Rx?

7. How to use it with MVC, WinForms, WPF, Silverlight, WCF?

8. Competitor technologies?

9. Create some small, real life examples to demo Rx. See the workshop videos on Channel 9 with Wes Dyer and Bart de Smet.

10. Operators, combinators.

11. Do a big real life example.

Version history of Rx. Current version. History of Rx.

How is Rx different from if I were to implement the observer design pattern?

Do the observer and the observed have to be in the same process?

Make a list of all the different types of events or collections I can make my own examples of observables to watch, at least the trivial ones.
Console.ReadLine
A web service call
Button clicks
Change in an integer or string collection or a collection of T
data read or coming in from a file


When is the Timer operator useful in a real world example?

Can't find ToTask
