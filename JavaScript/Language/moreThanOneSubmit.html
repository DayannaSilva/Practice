        /*
        The answer, therefore, is the event.stopImmediatePropagation() method.

        Event.stopPropagation():
        The stopPropagation() method prevents further propagation of the current event 
        in the capturing and bubbling phases.

        Event.stopImmediatePropagation():
        Prevents other listeners of the same event from being called.

        Event.preventDefault():
        The Event interface's preventDefault() method tells the user agent that if the 
        event does not get explicitly handled, its default action should not be taken as 
        it normally would be. The event continues to propagate as usual, unless one of 
        its event listeners calls stopPropagation() or stopImmediatePropagation(), either 
        of which terminates propagation at once.


        No, wait, wait, wait! I nailed it. I thought about it and it came. Here's what happens.
        event.preventDeault() does stop the submit, i.e.the postback (or whichever HTTP method) 
        which is the default behavior. However, it does not prevent the next listener in the chain
        from being called. event.stopImmediatePropagation() stops the next listener in the chain.
        Whether it also prevents the default behavior or not, I still have to check (and I might do that
        in a bit) but for now, I'll just call both of them -- event.preventDefault() and
        event.stopImmediatePropagation() and get on with it. Totally harmless and does the job correctly.

        Okay, I am testing that in this example named doesItStopPostback.html in this folder.
        That is a more evolved example of this same thing.
