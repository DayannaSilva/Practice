Can we have a script tag anywhere on the page? Test it.

If we can, it will help me write logic in an ASP.NET MVC View so as to
fill in a JavaScript collection. Something like:

<form>
	@if (!ModelState.IsValid) {
		<script>
			var validator = new validation.validator();
			validator.errors = [];
			
			@foreach(var error in ModelState.ModelErrors) {
				validator.errors.push(...);
			}
		</script>
	}
</form>

Ok, good news! We can.

Now, although I don't recommend this approach but this is what I am having to do
in this situation.

<html>
	<body>
		<div>
			<p>This is the first paragraph.</p>
			
			<script>
				alert("After the paragraph tag.");
			</script>
			
			<form>
				<input type = "text" />
					<script>
						alert("In the form element in between two input types.");
					</script>
				<input type = "submit" value = "Submit" />
			</form>
			
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
