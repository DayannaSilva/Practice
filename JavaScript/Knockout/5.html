	<!-- The purpose of this program is to find out whether 
		the text: binding will update if I have an observable but
		I won't have a value: binding to update th model. Instead, 
		I will update the model in the browser console.
		
		Apparently, the text: binding needs a refresh. It does not update.
		It probably reads the value once only when it first loads the page, 
		i.e. when it is first initialized.
