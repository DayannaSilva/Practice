    Is the window.unload fired when you switch from one 
    page of the same website to another? Or only when 
    you close the window?

    
    It happens everytime the DOM is unloaded. This means 
    it also happens when you switch from one page to another 
    even if the two pages are on the same domain.

    <a href="one.html">Page one on the same website.</a>
