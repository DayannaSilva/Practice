All the things you run after -- that great job, that life partner, that car, that house, those possessions, that bank balance, a place in that inner circle of elites, that position in society, social status, those things -- are things that actually bind you, exhaust you, kill you slowly.

Everything you own actually owns you. You run after it only to enslave yourself.

Every possession of yours consumes you.

Every job, relation, position, authority binds you to responsibility and duty, which exhausts you.

All the things you have asked for, are things you ought to have been running away from if you wanted peace.

Be careful what you pray for. You *always* get it.

To attain peace, make peace with what you have.
