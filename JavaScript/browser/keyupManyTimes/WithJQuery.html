    <p>It appears that the keyup event is sent multiple times. That is, it fires many times.</p>

    <p>The behaviour I observed was that it fired once the first time, then twice the second time, thrice the third time and so on.</p>

    <p>I observed this while developing my website <a href="https://sathyaish.net">sathyaish.net</a>.</p>

    <p>I am doing this example to isolte the scenario and see if it is actually the case of multiple events firing or it is something with my code.</p>

        <b><u>Solution</u></b><br />
        Nothing to do with jQuery. It's because the handlers need to be removed. They were being added again and again on the show functionality.

    <button id = "btnShow">Show the textbox</button>
