All of existence is a wave. The wave has a peak and a trough.

So it is with all else. There are only dualities.

It must follow then that there will be times of loss, too. But despair not. For all is not what you make of it. It is not at all what it seems.

Suffering is the God inside you knocking the doors of your heart from the inside, asking out as loud as He can.

"Anyone there?"

"Are you listening, my child?"

"Have you begun asking the right questions of life?"

"Don't be scared. It's just me trying to find out if you're done looking outside?"

"The world is unreal to its core and will never appease you. Have you found that out already? Seen through the matrix? Are you ready to look inside? Are you ready to find me?"
