        <p>
            In this example, I use a hidden file input control, i.e. an input control of type file, allowing the user to select only image files. Then, I display a preview of all the images the user has selected.
        </p>

        <p>The only difference between this one and the previous one, 6.html, is that this one uses a label control instead of a button to allow the user to click on to select files. And since the label is <code>for</code> the file input control, the file input control's visibility should not be set to hidden using <code>style = display: none;</code> because then that input control won't receive events. Instead, it must be fooled into being invisible using any of the visual techniques such as the one set below (<code>style = opacity: 0</code>).</p>

    <div id = "formContainer">
        <form enctype = "multipart/form-data" method = "POST">
            <label for = "file">Click here to select files to upload</label>
            <input type = "file" style = "opacity: 0;" id = "file" name = "file" />
            <span id = "numImages" style = "display: none;"></span>
            <input type = "submit" value = "" id = "btnSubmit" style = "display: none;" />
            <div id = "previewContainer"></div>
        </form>
