How do you compose composite fields out of two or more existing model properties?

How do I subscribe to changes in either the individual model members or their composite / computed properties? I'd like to do something if either the first or the last name changes. Or if the computed Full Name changes.

$scope.$watch('propertyName', function(newValue, oldValue) {
	// Your code here
});
