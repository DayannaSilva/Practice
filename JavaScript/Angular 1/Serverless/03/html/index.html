<!--
I first used the following to create the angular app.

<html data-ng-app = "">

However, I got an error saying the CustomersController was not registered.

The comments on this question I subsequently posted about this suggest that 
they removed the ability to declaratively create an angular app
or module since angular 1.2. Therefore, the following directive will not work:

<html data-ng-app = "">

I am leaving this code as is, that is, with its error due to the breaking change.

I will fix this in a subsequent example so that I have the error on record.

It appears now that the only way to create a module and associate a controller with it
is to do it programmatically.

No wait! All the previous examples used the ng-app directive and they worked. I am not sure
what the guy is saying except that some of the things have changed. It is advisable therefore
that I read the most recent documentation.
