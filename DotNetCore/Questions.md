1. How in VS Codce a solution with multiple projects? And debugging between the projects just like in Visual Studio or any other full-fledged IDE?
Answer: I think the full answer will come as I read the documentation, do things in Visual Studio, then think and then watch some videos for developing ASP.NET applications on MacOS and Linux, but this video and a few other videos from this guy help a lot. Basically, you don't create DLL's. You create folders. Just like a node app.
